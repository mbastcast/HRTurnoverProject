# Human Resources Turnover Analysis

One of the biggest issues a company can face is employee turnover, this is due to the fact that it is difficult to predict and frequently results in observable gaps in the company's trained workforce.

Businesses understand that when employees departs unexpectedly, the timely supply of their services may be jeopardized, total company productivity may drastically diminish, and as a result, client loyalty may suffer. Organizations must therefore develop appropriate acquisition, retention, and recruitment strategies, as well as practical preventative and mitigating measures, while also comprehending the underlying, primary causes of employee turnover. This project attempts to works on the latter.

With the usage of Data Analytics tools the following solutions were provided:

### A Tableau Dashboard


The Turnover Dashboard provides a snapshot of who has left the company. This allows HR and top management to see the aggregated and current numbers in an instant. By understanding the characteristics of leavers the company can also make discuss which causes of departure are inevitable due to the nature of the job or which ones could have proactive actions to reduce turnover rates.

### MYSQL Useful Queries and Stored procedures


Any business, must have an HR database. Business operations that were in place prior to the database system's adoption cost the company a lot of money. This project proposed MySQL will be utilized as the DBMS for HRIS usage because it is web-based, runs on a server, and enables both interests to coexist, whether they are accessed via localhost or the internet. Another benefit is that the human resource database may now be viewed anywhere, at any time, provided the user has internet access and a device that can visit websites through browsers. But of course the biggest benefit is being able to use queries to easily extract information for further analyisis.

### Machine Learning Turnonver Predictor


The objective of this part of the project is to explain, illustrate, and evaluate supervised machine learning techniques for predicting employee turnover inside an organization. For this several models are carried out. The effectiveness of each of these supervised machine learning algorithms for forecasting employee turnover is presented and established utilizing statistical methods.
